The MFEM library has a serial and an MPI-based parallel version, which largely
share the same code base. The only prerequisite for building the serial version
of MFEM is a (modern) C++ compiler, such as g++. The parallel version of MFEM
requires an MPI C++ compiler, as well as the following external libraries:

- hypre (a library of high-performance preconditioners)
  http://www.llnl.gov/CASC/hypre

- METIS (a family of multilevel partitioning algorithms)
  http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/metis/overview

The build system is based on GNU make, as described below.


Quick start
===========
Serial build:
   make serial -j 4

Parallel build:
   (download hypre 2.10.0b and METIS 4 from above URLs)
   (build METIS 4 in ../metis-4.0 relative to mfem/)
   (build hypre 2.10.0b in ../hypre-2.10.0b relative to mfem/)
   make parallel -j 4

Example codes (serial/parallel, depending on the build):
   cd examples
   make -j 4

Build everything (library, examples and miniapps) with current configuration:
   make all -j 4

Quick-check the build by running Example 1/1p (optional):
   make check


Building with GNU make
======================
The MFEM build system consists of two steps: configuration and compilation.

The configuration step can be used to adjust paths to external libraries,
compilers, flags, etc, similar to "./configure". It is performed by running

   make config [OPTIONS] ...

The OPTIONS are of the form VARIABLE=VALUE. Detailed description of the
configuration options is given below. Alternatively, the options can be
specified with an input file:

   cp config/defaults.mk config/user.mk
   (edit config/user.mk)
   make config

Note that config/user.mk, if present, is loaded after config/defaults.mk and
its path/name can be changed with

   make config USER_CONFIG=user_config_file

Once configured, the library can be built simply with

   make

Note that re-configuration is only needed to change the currently configured
options. Several shortcut targets combining (re-)configuration and compilation
are also defined:

   make serial   -> Builds serial optimized version of the library
   make parallel -> Builds parallel optimized version of the library
   make debug    -> Builds serial debug version of the library
   make pdebug   -> Builds parallel debug version of the library

Note that any of the above shortcuts accept configuration options, either at the
command line or through a user configuration file.

The build can be quick-tested by running

   make check

which will simply compile and run Example 1/1p. For more extensive tests that
check the results from all the serial/parallel MFEM examples and miniapps use:

   make test

Note that running all the tests may take a while. Implementation details about
the check and test targets can be found in the top-level makefile and the
config/test.mk file.

An optional installation of the library and the headers can be performed with

   make install [PREFIX=<dir>]

The library will be installed in $(PREFIX)/lib, the headers in
$(PREFIX)/include, and the configuration makefile (config.mk) in $(PREFIX).
The PREFIX option can also be set during configuration.

Information about the current build configuration can be viewed using

   make status
   make info

To clean the library and object files, but keep the current configuration, use

   make clean

To clean everything, including the current configuration, use

   make distclean

For a short help message, use

   make help

The build process creates the MFEM library (libmfem.a) and the include file
(mfem.hpp) needed in MFEM-based applications, see e.g. the example codes in the
examples/ directory or the miniapps in the miniapps/ directory. A selected
subset of configuration options and derived makefile variables are also written
to the file config/config.mk. This file can be included by other makefiles to
obtain information about the MFEM configuration, see e.g. the makefile in the
examples/ directory.


Configuration options
=====================
Compilers:
   CXX    - C++ compiler, serial build
   MPICXX - MPI C++ compiler, parallel build

Compiler options:
   OPTIM_FLAGS - Options for optimized build
   DEBUG_FLAGS - Options for debug build
   CXXFLAGS    - If not set, defined based on the above optimized/debug flags
   CPPFLAGS    - Additional compiler options

Installation options:
   PREFIX  - Specify the installation directory. The library (libmfem.a) will be
             installed in $(PREFIX)/lib, the headers in $(PREFIX)/include, and
             the configuration makefile (config.mk) in $(PREFIX).
   INSTALL - Specify the install program, e.g /usr/bin/install

MFEM library features/options
-----------------------------
MFEM_USE_MPI = YES/NO
   Choose parallel/serial build. The parallel build requires proper setup of the
   HYPRE_* and METIS_* library options, see below.

MFEM_DEBUG = YES/NO
   Choose debug/optimized build. The debug build enables a number of messages
   and consistency checks that may simplify bug-hunting.

MFEM_USE_METIS_5 = YES/NO
   Specify the version of the METIS library - 5 (YES) or 4 (NO).

MFEM_USE_LAPACK = YES/NO
   Use LAPACK routines for various dense linear algebra operations. When
   enabled, this option uses the LAPACK_* library options, see below. (When not
   enabled MFEM provides simple internal implementations where appropriate.)

MFEM_THREAD_SAFE = YES/NO
   Use thread-safe implementation for some classes/methods. This comes at the
   cost of extra memory allocation and de-allocation.

MFEM_USE_OPENMP = YES/NO
   Enable (basic) experimental OpenMP support. Requires MFEM_THREAD_SAFE.

MFEM_USE_MEMALLOC = YES/NO
   Internal MFEM option: enable batch allocation for some small objects.
   Recommended value is YES.

MFEM_TIMER_TYPE = 0/1/2/3/NO
   Specify which library functions to use in the class StopWatch used for
   measuring time. The available options are:
      0  - use std::clock from <ctime>, standard C++
      1  - use times from <sys/times.h>
      2  - use high-resolution POSIX clocks (see option POSIX_CLOCKS_LIB)
      3  - use QueryPerformanceCounter from <windows.h>
      NO - use option 3 if the compiler macro _WIN32 is defined, 0 otherwise

MFEM_USE_MESQUITE = YES/NO
   Enable MFEM functionality based on the Mesquite library. When enabled, this
   option uses the MESQUITE_* library options, see below.

MFEM_USE_SUITESPARSE = YES/NO
   Enable MFEM functionality based on the SuiteSparse library. Currently, this
   option adds the classes UMFPackSolver and KLUSolver (both sparse serial
   direct solvers). When enabled, this option uses the SUITESPARSE_* library
   options, see below.

MFEM_USE_SUPERLU = YES/NO
   Enable MFEM functionality based on the SuperLU_DIST library. Currently, this
   option adds the classes SuperLUSolver (a parallel sparse direct solver) and
   SuperLURowLocMatrix a distributed CSR matrix class needed by SuperLU. When
   enabled, this option uses the SUPERLU_* library options, see below.

MFEM_USE_GNUTLS = YES/NO
   Enable secure socket support in class socketstream, using the auxiliary
   GnuTLS_* classes, based on the GnuTLS library. This option may be useful in
   multi-user environment to prevent users from sending/receiving visualization
   data to/from other users. When this option is enabled, the default behavior
   in class socketstream is to use secure sockets, e.g. when connecting to a
   GLVis visualization server. In order for this to work, one needs to generate
   GLVis server/client key pairs (in ~/.config/glvis), similar to ssh keys --
   the script 'glvis-keygen.sh' in the main GLVis directory can be used to do
   that:
      bash glvis-keygen.sh ["Your Name"] ["Your Email"]
   When MFEM_USE_GNUTLS is enabled, the additional build options, GNUTLS_*, are
   also used, see below.

MFEM_USE_NETCDF = YES/NO
   NetCDF is the library that is used by the SNL Cubit mesh generator to create
   Genesis mesh files. This option enables a reader for these files, which
   requires that NetCDF be installed, see the NETCDF_* build options below.

MFEM_BUILD_TAG = (any value)
   An optional tag to characterize the build. Exported to config/config.mk.
   Can be used to identify the MFEM build from other makefiles.

VERBOSE = YES/NO
   Print some informational messages when building.

External libraries:
-------------------
Two types of library configuration options are used:
   <LIBNAME>_OPT - for compiler options which usually specify an include path,
                   e.g.: -I/home/user/hypre/include
   <LIBNAME>_LIB - for link options which usually specify link path and library
                   name, e.g.: -L/home/user/hypre/lib -lHYPRE

If specifying relative paths, they should be relative to the top-level MFEM
directory and use the string @MFEM_DIR@, e.g. HYPRE_OPT = -I@MFEM_DIR@/../hypre.

The specific libraries and their options are:

- HYPRE, required for the parallel build, i.e. when MFEM_USE_MPI = YES.
  URL: http://www.llnl.gov/CASC/hypre
  Options: HYPRE_OPT, HYPRE_LIB.

- METIS, required for the parallel build, i.e. when MFEM_USE_MPI = YES. If using
  METIS 5, set MFEM_USE_METIS_5 = YES (default is to use METIS 4).
  URL: http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/metis/overview
  Options: METIS_OPT (currently not used/needed), METIS_LIB.

- LAPACK (optional), used when MFEM_USE_LAPACK = YES. Alternative, optimized
  implementations can also be used, e.g. the ATLAS project.
  URL: http://www.netlib.org/lapack (LAPACK)
       http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net (ATLAS)
  Options: LAPACK_OPT (currently not used/needed), LAPACK_LIB.

- OpenMP (optional), usually part of compiler, used when MFEM_USE_OPENMP = YES.
  Options: OPENMP_OPT, OPENMP_LIB.

- High-resolution POSIX clocks: when using MFEM_TIMER_TYPE = 2, it may be
  necessary to link with a system library (e.g. librt.so).
  Option: POSIX_CLOCKS_LIB (default = -lrt).

- Mesquite (optional), used when MFEM_USE_MESQUITE = YES.
  URL: http://trilinos.org/oldsite/packages/mesquite
  Options: MESQUITE_OPT, MESQUITE_LIB.

- SuiteSparse (optional), used when MFEM_USE_SUITESPARSE = YES.
  URL: http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html
  Options: SUITESPARSE_OPT, SUITESPARSE_LIB.

- SuperLU_DIST (optional), used when MFEM_USE_SUPERLU = YES. Note that
  SuperLU_DIST requires ParMETIS which, in turn, requires METIS (see above URL).
  URL: http://crd-legacy.lbl.gov/~xiaoye/SuperLU
  Options: SUPERLU_OPT, SUPERLU_LIB.

- GnuTLS (optional), used when MFEM_USE_GNUTLS = YES. On most Linux systems,
  GnuTLS is available as a development package, e.g. gnutls-devel. On Mac OS X,
  one can get the library through the Homebrew package manager (http://brew.sh).
  URL: http://gnutls.org
  Options: GNUTLS_OPT, GNUTLS_LIB.

- NetCDF (optional), used when MFEM_USE_NETCDF = YES, required for reading Cubit
  mesh files. Also requires installation of HDF5 and ZLIB, as explained at the
  NetCDF web site. Note that we use the plain vanilla "C" version of NetCDF, you
  don't need the C++ or parallel versions.
  URL: www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf
  Options: NETCDF_OPT, NETCDF_LIB.


Building without GNU make
=========================
Before using another build system (e.g. Visual Studio) it is necessary to create
a proper configuration header file, config/config.hpp, using the template from
config/config.hpp.in:

   cp config/config.hpp.in config/config.hpp

The file config/config.hpp can then be edited to enable desired options.  The
MFEM library is simply a combination of all object files obtained by compiling
the .cpp source files in the source directories: general, linalg, mesh, and fem.
